/**
 * Animate — scroll, hover, click and load animations for any block.
 *
 * The editor half writes attributes on a block. The published half is one client
 * script this extension puts on the page, which reads those attributes and
 * drives the animation. Neither half knows the other beyond the attribute names
 * in `animation.js`.
 *
 * The split is what makes it work at all. A client script does not run in the
 * editor canvas, so nothing moves while you edit: the panel shows what a block
 * is set to, and the published page shows what it does.
 *
 * The left panel is the only surface that writes those attributes. It reads a
 * block once, when the selection moves, so a second editor for the same six
 * values would leave the panel showing what the block no longer says.
 *
 * The runtime lands on a page the first time somebody animates a block on it,
 * never at startup. A page nobody animated carries no script of ours.
